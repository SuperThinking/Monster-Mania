# Monster Mania 3.0 {Still has a lot of small issues that I am working upon in my free time}<br />
Added a Main Menu with 2 options:
1) Single Player (Basic -> Same as version 2.0 + Added Eye Movements that track the Food (Only the main character image changes LOL!))

2) Vs BOT (Beta) (A bot also moves in the game that also collects Burgers and steal your points (Scoring System is still to be changed in this mode)).
